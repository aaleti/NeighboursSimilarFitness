# Neighbours Similar Fitness

The Neighbours Similar Fitness (NSF) is a new property of fitness landscapes that allows us to study the effectiveness of restart strategies. NSF states that neighbours are more likely to have similar fitness values than non neighbours. 

In this repository, we provide a set of fitness landscapes with and without the NSF property, which have been used in our paper linked below. In addition, we provide the code that can be used to create new NSF landscapes, which we hope will help researchers investigate this property further.
